The contibutions speak to various scenarios.  The major clusters of presumed scenarios will be described below as the contributions come in.  

* What are people doing?

* What of the people?

* What is the data?

* What rules do or should apply?

The active development on the format for describing contextual scenarios is being [developed by K. Krasnow Waterman and Dazza Greenwood](https://github.com/LegalScience/BigDataDialog/blob/master/ScenariosOfContext.md) and will be merged with this section.
