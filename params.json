The BigDataDialog project aims to provide a forum where virtually limitless numbers of people and organizations can express their points of view and a set of corresponding methods and mechanisms enabling:\r\n\r\n* *Reference to* the points of view, by ensuring each contribution exists at a stable URL with key associated services such as RSS and common approaches to identfying the content and facets of meaning underlying the points of view in structured data formats such as JSON; and\r\n\r\n* *Reflection upon* the points of view, by use of online annotation and participatory iteration methods such as those available through GitHub; and\r\n\r\n* *Refining of* the points of view, by use of a live forum programs for **discussion and debate** featuring the Google Hangout video conference tool and the *MIT Media Lab Unhangout* approach for **scalable collaboration and self-organiing iteration** of points of view *about* the points of view. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this repository is to leverage the capabilities of GitHub to provide reliable and accessible version control or key files of and resulting from the BigDataDialog initiative.  This GitHub repository is intended to enable more and better data-driven apps and services used and in some cases adapted or developed in support of the BigDataDialog processes. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
