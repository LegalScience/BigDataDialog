# BigDataDialog Data Repository Service

## BigDataDialog Identity and Intention: 

This is the MIT Human Dynamics Lab LegalScience research team's GitHub Repository for the BigDataDialog national discussion on Big Data.  

The name "BigDataDialog" was selected for two reasons:  The BigDataDialog is inteded to enable and help focus a new type of national discussion that at once uses big data techniques as a *means* for organizing and wrking with large volumes of input and is also *about* big data law, policy and practice. 

## BigDataDialog Purposes and Processes: 

These online dialogs include discussion of the questions posed by White House it it's request for information about big data and public policy but are not limited to those question or that RFI process.  The BigDataDialog project aims to provide a forum where virtually limitless numbers of people and organizations can express their points of view and a set of corresponding methods and mechanisms enabling:

* *Reference to* the points of view, by ensuring each contribution exists at a stable URL with key associated services such as RSS and common approaches to identfying the content and facets of meaning underlying the points of view in structured data formats such as JSON; and
* *Reflection upon* the points of view, by use of online annotation and participatory iteration methods such as those available through GitHub; and
* *Refining of* the points of view, by use of a live forum programs for **discussion and debate** featuring the Google Hangout video conference tool and the *MIT Media Lab Unhangout* approach for **scalable collaboration and self-organiing iteration** of points of view *about* the points of view. 

The purpose of this repository is to leverage the capabilities of GitHub to provide reliable and accessible version control or key files of and resulting from the BigDataDialog initiative.  This GitHub repository is intended to enable more and better data-driven apps and services used and in some cases adapted or developed in support of the BigDataDialog processes.
