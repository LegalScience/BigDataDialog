### Working Draft Template: 

**1: What are people doing?**

* What is the transaction they are conducting or the other key interaction.

**2: What of the people?**

* Roles and Relationships:

**3: What is the data?**

* Describe the data.  Where did it come from?  When if at all does it change?  

**4: What rules do or should apply**

### Commentary and Notes:

* As a ref, check out the [Google Form w/Current Best Guess of Context/Scenario Template](https://docs.google.com/a/civics.com/document/d/17A8fp89gJ0MROTorrOtLENRuil5fUqNXh1OcppEwt2s/edit) 

* Wondering how best to deal with the time axis... might be we take a pass on that complexity for purposes of this imminent round of public input.
